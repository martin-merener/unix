Configuring git:

	git config --global user.name "<Last First names>"
	git config --global user.email "<email address>"

	git config --list
		This will list all the configuration values


Getting help:

	git <command> --help

	For example: git config --help
	Also works: git help config


-----------------------------------
Initializing an existing repository
-----------------------------------

	cd <desired directory>
	git init

	ls -la
		Lists all items, including hidden ones, like hidden directory .git, containing everything about the git repository.
		So to stop using git and stop tracking changes, remove the .git folder: rm -rf .git (in the desired directory).


To ignore files that we do not want git to track, create a hidden fite called .gitignore, listing the files to ignore.
	touch .gitignore
		It's a text file listing in each row a file or directory name to be ignored.
		E.g., to ignore the compiled bytecode files with extension .pyc, add the line *.pyc
			These files are created by python when one imports a module, so that next time it is imported it is faster.
		E.g., ignore a hidden file called .myStuff
		Once the .gitignore file is created, it has to be added and committed (the .gitignore file is tracked by git)


Add files:
	git add -A
		adds all new/changed files.

	git add .gitignore
		it adds that particular file to the staging area.

Working directory: everything in the directory was are working on.
Staging area: the stuff that was added.

After adding, but before committing, one can remove files from the staging area:
	git reset <added_file>
		This will have the same effect as not having added the file.
	git reset
		This will have the same effect as not having added any file.

Committing changes in the staging area:
	git commit -m "<detailed message>"

See commits history:
	git log


---------------------------
Cloning a remote repository
---------------------------

Clone a url:
	git clone <https://github...>

See information about the remote repository:
	git remote -v
	git branch -a

After making changes in the local repository:
	git diff
		Shows the changes made to the code

	git status
		Shows the items in the working directory, yet not in staging

	git add -A
		adds items to staging area

	git commit -m "<message>"

After committing all changes one may want to push the changes to the remote branch that one is working on.
Before pushing, one should push in case there were changes while we worked.

	git pull origin master
	git push origin master

	(or whatever branch one is working on)

In reality one usually works on a branch.

	git branch <new_branch_name>
		creates a new branch

	git checkout <branch_name>
		switches to the branch

	git branch
		lists all existing branches

After making all the desired changes in the branch:

	git add -Add
	git commit -m "<message>"
		This only affected the local branch we are working on.

We can now push the new changes committed to the current branch in the remote repository.

	git push -u origin <branch-name>
		This associates the branch name to the remote repository, from now on.

	git branch -a
		lists all branches, local and remote.


After doing a git pull, do git fetch (otherwise it says that local is n commits ahead)

Once the local and remote branches are in sync, we can merge the branch to the master (or whatever other branch the current one branched off, e.g., development).
In this example we merge the new updated branch to the master branch.
	git checkout master
		go to the branch from which we want to merge.
	git pull origin master
		we are local, so we first want to make sure master has all the last changes in the remote.
	git branch --merged
		Shows what branches were merged to master branch.
	git merge <branch_name_to_merge_to_master>
		Now the feature branch was merged to the master branch (local)
	git push origin master
		Now the local master (with the new feature branch just merged to it) is pushed to the remote master branch.
	(go to other local repositories, if any, e.g., one in laptop and one in the node, and update that repo too:
		git checkout master
		git pull origin master
		git fetch
	)
	git branch --merged
		will show that the feature branch was merged
	git branch -d <branch_name_to_merge_to_master>
		Since the feature branch was merged, it can now be deleted. But this is local.
	git branch -a
		Will show if the feature branch is still in the remote repository.
	git push origin --delete <branch_name_to_merge_to_master>
		Will delete the feature branch from the remote.
	git branch -a
		Will show that the feature branch was deleted from the remote.
	git remote prune origin
		Still need to remove the branch in other local repos (e.g., note)

YouTube: Git Tutorial series - Fixing Common Mistakes and Undoing Bad Commits
====================================================================================

How to undo mistakes.
We make changes to a file, and then we realize we want to undo all those changes.

After making changes, we do 
	git status
		See the file has been modified in the working directory
	git diff
		See the differences between current in staging and new changes

	git checkout <file_name>
	git status
		we will see that the working directory is clean

	git diff
		No changes

Now suppose we do changes, and we add and commit the file.
We may make a mistake in the commit message. 
	git log
		shows the commit but with the wrong message.

	git commit --amend -m "<correct message>"
	
	git log
		will not add a new commit, but just modify the message as desired
		Note that the hash of the commit gets updated (the amend in the mesage is part of the commit)
		There are ways of correcting commits without changing the history (hashes).

Suppose we add a .gitignore file but we want it to be part of the last commit.
We update the .gitignore and then add the file.
	git commit -- ammend [enter]
		Opens the editor to change the commit message. Save and close

	git log
		Will not show a new commit 
	git log --stat
		will show the files updated in the commit
	Again this changes the hash

Suppose we made a bunch of commits to the master branch instead of a feature branch we were working on.
This is fairly common mistake. Committing to the wrong branch.
We can move a commit in the master branch to the feature branch.
This means two things: make the committed changes actually into the feature branch, and return the master branch to the state it was before the wrong commit.
	We do "cherry pick"
	git log
		Grab the hash of the commit we want to move

	git checkout <feature_branch>

	git log
		Check we only have the commits before the one we meant to make

	git cherry-pick <copied hash>

	git log
		will show the commit in the feature branch

But cherry-pick does not delete the commit in the master branch
We will do a reset. There are three types of reset.
Soft reset:
	git checkout master

	git log
		copy and paste the hash of the commit we want to delete

	git reset --soft <copied hash>

	git log
		will show the wrong commit is gone

	git status
		it will show that the files of the wrong commit to the master branch are still in the staging area

Default (mix) reset
	git reset <copied hash> 
		This is the default, mix

	git log
		the wrong commit is gone

	git status
		now the changes in the commit we made (wrong) are still in the working directory (not in the staging area)

Hard reset

	git reset --hard <copied hash>

	git log
		same as before

	git status
		resets the tracked files. So we sill still see untracked files in the working directory

To get rid of the untracked files:
	git clean -df [untracked directories and files]

	git status
		done.

If we actually did not want to remove the commit

	git reflog
		shows all the things we did in the commits from most recent to oldest.

We would grab the hash right before the reset what we did wrong.
	git checkout <hash>

	git log

		Now are not in a branch. We are in a "detached head-state"
		Where we are is going to be trashed in the future.
		To save the changes we need to make a branch out of it.

	git branch backup

	git branch
		will show we are in a HEAD detached
		will show the backup branch

	git checkout master

	git branch
		shows the backup branch

	git checkout backup

So reflog can be useful if we deleted things that we needed.

Another way to fix commits that were wrong, is to use revert. This is new commits. Not re-writing history. Does not modify or delete existing commits.
It makes new commits on top of those. Just reverting the undesired effects.

	git log

		will show the commit we did wrong, but other people already checked out that commit
		grab the hash.

	git revert hash
		keep the message as default

	git log
		will show the previous commits (including the wrong one), plus the new commit of the revert.

	git diff hash_wrong_commit hash_revert_commit
		shows the difference between the two commits 



======================================================
YouTube: Git Tutorial series - Using the Stash Command
======================================================

git stash command: it allows to put changes made in a temporary place, if we are not sure what to do with them.
With the changes in the stash, we can switch to other branch, and keep working, until we figure out what to do with the stashed changes.

After some changes were made, we can do:

	git stash save "<message about the stashed chenges>"

	git diff
		nothing to show

	git status
		nothing to commit

	git stash list
		will show the stashes (with message)

To bring the changes back:

	git stash apply stash@{0}
		will bring back the changes. But will keep the stash

	git stash list
		will show the stash is still there 

	git stash pop
		this will grab the first stash in the list, apply the changes, and drop it

	git stash list
		will not show the stash any more

	git diff
		now will show the difference

	git stash drop stash@{n} 
		will drop the indicated stash

	git stash clear
		remove all stashes

Git stash can also be used if we did changes in the wrong branch (e.g., master), but were meant to another branch, and we do not want to lose them
So we can stash them, then switch to the right branch, and take the changes from the stash pile. Stash is carried over from branch to branch.

	git stash 
	git checkout <right branch>
	git stash pop



==================================================================================
YouTube: Git Tutorial: Difference between "add -A", "add -u", "add .", and "add *"
==================================================================================

These two are the same:
	git add --all
	git add -A
		add all the new/modified/deleted changes in the entire working tree (directories and subdirectories) to the staging area

	git add -A my_dir/
	git add my_dir/ (but in git v1 would leave unadded the deleted files)
		only adds the new/modified/deleted changes within that directory

	git add --update
	git add -u
		adds all modified/deleted. Not the new files (untracked). This is for the entire working tree.

	git add -u my_dir/
		only in the directory

	git add . 
		Seems to be the same things as git add -A. But this is true only if you are in the top directory.
		If you are in a subdirectory, git add ., would add all modified/deleted/new files in the current directory and subdirectories.
		While git add -A (run in a subdirectory), would add all modified/deleted/new files in the entire working tree.s



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After creating a branch in the remote repository, using the web-browser interface
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you create a branch, you need to check it out from your local system. Use the fetch and checkout commands:

	git fetch && git checkout <branch_name>

Make your changes locally and then add, commit, and push your changes to the branch:

	git add .
	git commit -m "adding ..."
	git push origin <branch_name>


---------------------------
To create a branch locally
---------------------------

First go to the branch from which we want to branch off:
	
	git checkout <branch_from_where_to_branch_off, e.g., master, development>

Creates a new feature branch:

	git branch <feature_branch>

Switch to the new branch:

	git checkout <feature_branch>



------------------------------------------
Add a branch created locally to the remote
------------------------------------------

After creating a branch locally, say "feature" branched from master, and commiting changes to it, we may want to push changes to the remote.
For that we use:
	git push --set-upstream origin feature
Now the feature will be a new branch in the remote repository.
